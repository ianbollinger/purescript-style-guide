# PureScript style guide

This is a style guide for the language PureScript based on conventions used in
its core libraries. A style guide is a set of conventions about how to write
code for a project. It is easier to read a project's source code when it all has
a consistent style. It is easier to contribute code to a project when there is
no question as to how something should be formatted.
